# Welcome to Dungeon Dave!

**Start the game:**
- python dungeon.py

**Help:**
- python dungeon.py help

**Exit:**
- Type 'bye' at any time to exit the game

**System Requirements:**
- Game runs on the WINDOWS CMD prompt (do not use linux or a linux shell)
- You need the numpy package

**Note:**
- Dungeon is RANDOMY populated with monsters and treasures
- There is a 75% chance of a monster and 25% chance of treasure in ANY room
- The agility stat is visible but (sadly) not used in the game. Next time!
- The most interesting (and I supposed difficult) thing in the game was to establish the game loop. Enjoy!
